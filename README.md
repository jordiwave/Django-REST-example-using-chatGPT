The Intellectual Property Law currently determines that only natural persons can be subjects of authorship. That is why the content or information generated by ChatGPT is not subject to copyright. In other words, we speak of plagiarism only when an individual uses another person's intellectual property without acknowledging the source or obtaining the author's consent. Therefore, as ChatGPT does not possess its own intellectual property, its contents can be used. However, if the information on which the platform is based were to be plagiarized, its responses would consequently be as well.
